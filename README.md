## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the production, pricing, and distribution strategies for Crafty Brews Brewing Company, a craft beer producer. The primary goal is to maximize weekly profits while meeting client demand and adhering to budgetary and capacity constraints.

## Background
Crafty Brews offers a variety of craft beers, including IPA, Stout, Lager, Pilsner, Wheat Beer, and Saison, which are distributed to bars, restaurants, and retail stores. The company faces several challenges, including balancing production costs, managing delivery logistics, and meeting client preferencesâ€”all while operating under a weekly budget and ensuring no inventory holding.
